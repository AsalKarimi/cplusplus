This code solves ax+by+cz+...=k
k-k'=Δ=ax+by+cz+...-k'
Δ^2=[(ax+by+cz+...)-k']^2=...
dΔ^2/da---> a<x^2>+b<xy>+c<xz>+...=<kx>
dΔ^2/db---> ...
so we have a NxN matrix with the main diagonal of <X^2>, <y^2>,...
we are trying to find a, b and c

This is the first time I'm doing this so if you have any questions or hints please let me know<3
